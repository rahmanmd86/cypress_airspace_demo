Airspace code challenge

Airspace QA Challenge

- Your team just built an awesome new app! Your task is to write an automated regression suite
for the login component of the app.
- Please feel free to use any tool you are most comfortable with. For a test like this, the Airspace
QA team would likely use Cypress (cypress.io)
- Please make sure that your test names are well thought out so that someone unfamiliar can get
a good idea of what is being covered.
- You can find the app here: https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login
- Zip up your final submission and send via email, or feel free to check it in to your personal
github repository.
- Reach out with any questions, thanks!
